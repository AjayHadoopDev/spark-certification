//// mesos - can scale under reverse-proxy / web app
/// yarn - hadoop scale 

One advantage of Mesos over both YARN and Standalone mode is its fine-grained sharing option, 
which lets interactive applications such as the Spark shell scale down their CPU allocation between commands. 
This makes it attractive in environments where multiple users are running interactive shells.
